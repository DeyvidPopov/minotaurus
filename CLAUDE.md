# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repo layout

Two-tree monorepo with no root `package.json`. Always `cd` into the right tree first.

- `backend/` — Express + TypeScript + Prisma/PostgreSQL. ESM (`NodeNext`), run via `tsx` (no separate build step in dev).
- `frontend/nextjs/` — Next.js 14 App Router, React 18, Tailwind, React Flow, Mermaid, Zustand. Talks to the backend over HTTP through `lib/api/`.
- `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tweaks-panel.jsx`, `frontend/index.html` — **legacy** Vite/JSX prototype, kept only as a design reference. Do not edit unless explicitly asked.
- `docs/` — original product spec (`01_..11_*.md`) plus `docs/AI_CONTEXT/` which holds the **living** state docs (`CURRENT_STATE.md`, `FEATURE_PROGRESS.md`, `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`, `NEXT_STEPS.md`, `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`). Read those before guessing at intent — they are kept current per feature pass.
- `FRONTEND_RUNTIME_NOTES.md` — short-form local-runtime walkthrough (also covers the seeded demo flow).

## Common commands

### Backend (`cd backend`)

```
npm run dev              # tsx watch src/server.ts  (backend on :4000)
npm start                # tsx (no watcher)
npm run build            # prisma generate && tsc -p tsconfig.json  → dist/
npm run seed             # tsx scripts/seed-demo.ts — wipes + reseeds demo dataset
npm run test:api         # bash scripts/test-api.sh — full HTTP smoke pass (needs backend running)
npm run prisma:generate  # regenerate Prisma client
npm run prisma:migrate   # prisma migrate dev (interactive)
npm run prisma:reset     # prisma migrate reset --force (DESTRUCTIVE)
npm run prisma:studio    # Prisma Studio GUI
```

No unit-test framework — `scripts/test-api.sh` is the only automated coverage. To run a single endpoint, hit it with `curl` (patterns in `backend/API_TEST_EXAMPLES.md`).

### Frontend (`cd frontend/nextjs`)

```
npm run dev        # next dev    (frontend on :3000)
npm run build      # next build
npm run start      # next start
npm run lint       # next lint
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
```

### First-time bootstrap

PostgreSQL must be reachable at the URL in `backend/.env` (`DATABASE_URL`). The local install runs on **port 5433**, not the Postgres default 5432.

```
cd backend
npm install
psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 5433 -c "CREATE DATABASE minotaurus;"
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run seed
npm run dev

# separate terminal:
cd frontend/nextjs && npm install && npm run dev
```

Demo login (always provisioned by the seed): `deyvid@minotaurus.dev` / `minotaurus`.

## Architecture — what requires reading multiple files to grasp

### Backend request flow

`server.ts` → `app.ts` (cors + json + `/api` mount) → `routes.ts` (one master router that wires per-module sub-routers under nested paths, e.g. `/projects/:projectId/artifacts`, `/artifacts/:artifactId/relations`) → `modules/<feature>/<feature>.routes.ts` → `<feature>.controller.ts` → optional `<feature>.engine.ts` for pure logic.

Each module is self-contained: routes + controller + (engine when there's non-trivial logic). The same engines are reused by `scripts/seed-demo.ts` to bootstrap the demo, so engines must be pure functions over Prisma — no Express types inside.

ESM gotcha: relative imports inside `backend/src/` use `.js` suffixes (e.g. `from "./auth.controller.js"`) even though the source is `.ts`. This is required by `module: NodeNext` — preserve it when adding new files.

### API envelope (contract — do not break)

Every backend response is either:

```
{ "success": true,  "data": <T>, "message": "..." }
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }
```

Wrappers: `utils/response.ts` (`ok`, `created`, `fail`, `HttpError`) on the backend; `lib/api/client.ts` on the frontend unwraps `.data` and throws `ApiError` on failure. Pages call typed wrappers (`projectsApi`, `artifactsApi`, …) from `lib/api/*.ts` — **never `fetch` directly from a page or component**.

### Auth + project access

- JWT bearer tokens. `requireAuth` middleware in `middleware/auth.ts` validates the token and reloads the user from Prisma on every request.
- Project authorization lives in `lib/project-access.ts`, **not** in individual controllers. Use these helpers:
  - `getProjectAccess(projectId, userId)` — returns `{ status, role? }`.
  - `assertProjectRole(projectId, userId, res, minRole)` / `assertCanMutate(...)` — sends the right error response and returns `null` if denied.
  - Role hierarchy (low→high): `VIEWER < DEVELOPER < ARCHITECT < OWNER`. Mutations require `DEVELOPER`+; validation/export require `ARCHITECT`+; member management and project delete require `OWNER`.
- `Project.ownerId` is preserved as the "creator pointer" and is treated as an implicit OWNER membership if no `ProjectMember` row exists — this is the fallback that keeps legacy projects working. Do not remove it.
- Last-OWNER protection: the members API refuses to demote/remove the only remaining OWNER (`LAST_OWNER` error).

### Prisma client singleton

`lib/prisma.ts` exports one `PrismaClient` instance, cached on `globalThis.__prisma__` so `tsx watch` reloads don't pile up connection pools. Always import from there — do not `new PrismaClient()` anywhere else.

### Knowledge graph contract

`ArtifactRelation` is the **single source of truth** for the graph. `/api/projects/:id/graph` only emits artifact nodes — API specs, database models, and diagrams are intentionally **not** native graph nodes. Cross-resource navigation happens via the artifact detail page's "Linked resources" card. Keep this contract intact; the frontend graph code assumes it.

### Validation engine

`modules/validation/validation.engine.ts` is rule-based and **deterministic** — no AI / heuristic-soup logic. It wipes the project's existing `ValidationIssue` rows and recomputes them in one pass, then writes a single `VALIDATED` `VersionEvent`. Rules cover: artifact-relation hygiene, missing docs, security policies, API completeness, DB model integrity, diagram links, churn (≥5 CUDs in 7d), deprecated-but-still-used, single-member projects. Add new rules as pure functions inside the same engine.

### Artifact title uniqueness

Titles are unique **per project**, case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized (trim + collapse internal whitespace + lowercase). Enforced two ways and both must stay in sync:

1. DB: `Artifact.normalizedTitle` column + unique index `(projectId, normalizedTitle)`.
2. Controller: pre-check in create/update (and in the ingestion `CREATE_NEW` confirm path), returning 409 `ARTIFACT_TITLE_TAKEN`.

This applies **only** to `Artifact`. API specs, diagrams, database models, etc. allow duplicate titles within a project.

### Version events

Every CUD across the platform (artifacts, relations, API specs, endpoints, DB models/entities/fields, diagrams, documentation, members, validation runs, ingestion confirms) appends a `VersionEvent` via `modules/versions/versions.engine.ts:recordVersionEvent`. This feeds the version history timeline, the dashboard "Recent changes" widget, and the impact-analysis recent-events list. New mutations must record their event.

### Ingestion

`modules/ingestion/` has one controller plus four parser engines (`markdown`, `openapi`, `mermaid`, `sql`). Flow: draft → parse → confirm. Confirm uses the same artifact / API spec / diagram / DB model creation paths as the regular controllers (including the artifact title check) so ingestion never bypasses validation. Ingestion is an audit log — deleting an `IngestionRecord` does **not** cascade-delete the resources it produced (no FK on the join). UI copy reflects this ("Remove log" vs "Delete draft").

### Frontend shell

- `app/(app)/layout.tsx` wraps every workspace route with `AuthProvider` + `AppShell` (Sidebar + Topbar). `app/(auth)/` is the unauthenticated tree (login / register).
- Sidebar dynamically loads per-project sub-nav (Artifacts / Graph / API Specs / Database / Diagrams / Validation / Version History / Export). Topbar breadcrumbs resolve real entity titles by id.
- Theme / density / sidebar mode / accent / graph node style live in a Zustand "tweaks" store in `components/providers.tsx` and persist to `localStorage`. React Flow node positions also persist per-project in `localStorage` — not on the server.
- Standalone routes `/projects/[id]/docs` and `/projects/[id]/docs/[id]` are intentionally stubbed. Per-artifact Markdown lives inside the artifact detail page's Documentation tab; the project-wide Documentation Hub uses `?tab=documentation` deep-links into it.

### Viewport chrome (graph + Mermaid)

The Knowledge Graph uses React Flow's native `<Controls>` (horizontal, `position="bottom-center"`); the Mermaid viewer uses the [`ViewportControls`](frontend/nextjs/components/ui/viewport-controls.tsx) primitive. Both share a single visual contract via the `.react-flow__controls` and `.viewport-controls` blocks in [app/globals.css](frontend/nextjs/app/globals.css) — edit both blocks together when changing the chrome. `ViewportControls` is headless: the caller owns positioning and the zoom/pan state.

[`MermaidPreview`](frontend/nextjs/components/mermaid-preview.tsx) has an `interactive` prop (default `false`). Interactive mode wraps the SVG in a pan/zoom viewport with auto-fit on render and `ViewportControls` mounted bottom-center; it requires a fixed-size parent (caller passes `className="w-full h-full"` inside a sized container). Static callers — gallery thumbnails, ingestion preview, export preview, DB ERD — keep the default so thumbnail layouts don't break.

`.mermaid-host--interactive` deliberately omits `will-change: transform`. Adding it back composites the SVG to a GPU texture at its source resolution; zooming then bilinearly upscales the bitmap → pixelated diagrams. The current setup forces re-rasterization of the vector on each transform → crisp output.

## Conventions (from `docs/AI_CONTEXT/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`)

- Thin controllers — push non-trivial logic into `<feature>.engine.ts`.
- Frontend pages import typed wrappers from `lib/api/`; do not call `fetch` directly and do not duplicate DTO types (use `lib/types.ts`).
- Validation is rule-based and deterministic. Do not introduce AI-generated validation logic.
- `ArtifactRelation` is the graph source of truth — don't add a parallel "links" table or emit non-artifact nodes from the graph endpoint.
- Postgres is the source of truth (since Phase 6). The old `backend/src/db/data.json` JSON store is gone — don't reintroduce it.

## When in doubt

`docs/AI_CONTEXT/CURRENT_STATE.md` and `docs/AI_CONTEXT/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` are the up-to-date snapshots of what's shipped and what was just changed. Read them before assuming a feature is or isn't implemented — the original `docs/01..11_*.md` spec is product background, not the current contract.
